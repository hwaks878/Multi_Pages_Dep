              <h4>Costco Travel cover story</h4>
              <p>
                Another reason to use Costco Travel [“Destination: The world,”
                February 2023] is for rental cars. I had a rental car company
                try to bill me for over $1,000 worth of damage to the car after
                I had dropped it off. Because I rented through Costco, I was
                able to contact customer support and it was taken care of with
                no additional hassle on my end. If I had to fight with the car
                rental company, I don’t think it would have ended as happily.

              <h4>Highlighting heart health</h4>
              <p>
                I appreciated the article on atrial fibrillation [A-fib;
                “Getting in rhythm,” February 2023]. I had A-fib for years
                before I was properly diagnosed. Thankfully, it is now
                controlled with [medication] and avoidance of my strongest
                triggers: alcohol, as mentioned in the article; monosodium
                glutamate (MSG); and aspartame (an artificial sweetener).
                <br /><br />Identifying personal triggers and reading labels
                carefully can help avoid setting off an unexpected bout of this
                rhythmic disorder.

                Thank you for spotlighting a very common and potentially lethal
                heart arrhythmia. After my [fourth heart] attack, my physician
                suggested that I try a beta-blocker. I have been free of A-fib
                since starting the medication seven years ago.

              <p>
                Thanks, @Costco for promoting #economiccensus in your [February
                2023] #costcoconnection issue. Starting today millions of
                businesses in the U.S. will receive the Econ Census form,
                helping us [give] a full portrait of the economy.

              <h4>Sustainable actions</h4>
              <p>
                Bravo, Costco, for not only making a sustainability commitment
                but also for making it easy for customers to remain in the loop
                about it [“Meeting our goals,” January 2023]. To paraphrase
                something stated in the article, one step that may seem small
                really can make a difference.
